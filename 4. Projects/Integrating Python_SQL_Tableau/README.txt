My first steps:
	- in integrating Python, SQL and Tableau using Jupyter and csv files
	- in using the pandas and numpy modules of Python
	

The business case encloses to establish the reasons for absenteeism for work and to predict the main ones.
We used several data science models as standardization and logistic regression.

Jupyter is used to read csv files that are then preprocessed with Python by manipulating them and achieving the predicted results.
Then Jupyter and MySQL have been connected in order to store the data securely

A csv file with the result has been created and imported to Tableau to visualize them through meanigfull representations.
